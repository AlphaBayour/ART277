<h1><b>Travelling in Depression</b></h1>
<p>
    When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in <br>
    France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience.<br>
    At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco<br>
    feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, <br>
    megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old <br>
    stones were still in place.<br>
    It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language. 
    <br>
    <br>

    It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I <br>
    remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was. <br>
    But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more<br>
    accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered. <br>
    In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its <br>
    similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is <br>
    béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible <br>
    to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find <br>
    that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in
    Spanish. <br>
    Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied<br>
    Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a <br>
    character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by <br>
    combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning <br>
    mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I love <br> 
    spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.</p>
